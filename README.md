# hello-smtp
When I start learning a new programming language, my first "real" coding project is always a command-line SMTP submission tool. I've found this task to be complex enough to explore some of the nuance of the language and its standard libraries, while being simple enough to complete in a day or two and then move on. The functional requirements are well defined, which forces me to think through language idioms that might otherwise tempt me to warp the app's behavior to fit the language.

Fellow programmers have often asked me to share these little programs with them, so here they are. There are no build instructions, make files, or dependency lists; if you need help compiling one of these, then it isn't for you.
